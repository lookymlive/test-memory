3. Enhance training feedback mechanisms

### Long Term
1. Add social features
2. Develop mobile app version
3. Implement advanced analytics
4. Add integration with other memory training platforms

## Technical Debt

1. Need to refactor training components to share more code
2. Database queries need optimization for scale
3. Test coverage is minimal and needs expansion
4. Some UI components have duplicate functionality

## Deployment Status

- **Development**: Fully deployed to GitHub
- **Testing**: Ready for initial testing on Cloudflare Pages
