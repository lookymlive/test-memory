# Test Memory Project - Deployment Guide

## Project Overview

Test Memory is a web application for memory training exercises featuring different disciplines:
- Decimal Digits
- Binary Digits
- Matrices
- Shapes and Colors

The application uses:
- Next.js 14 with App Router
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- shadcn/ui for UI components
- Supabase for authentication and database

## Development Steps Completed

### 1. Project Setup
- Initialized Next.js project with TypeScript
- Configured Tailwind CSS
- Integrated shadcn/ui components
- Set up Supabase client connection
- Created theme configuration and dark mode support

### 2. Database Structure
- Created Supabase tables:
  - `profiles`: User profile information
  - `memory_disciplines`: Available memory disciplines
  - `training_sessions`: Record of user training attempts
  - `user_records`: Best scores for each user in each discipline
  - `competitions`: Information about scheduled competitions
  - `competition_results`: User performance in competitions

### 3. Authentication
- Implemented Supabase Auth for user management
- Created login and registration pages
- Set up middleware for protected routes
- Added user profile management

### 4. Training Disciplines
- Created discipline selection page
- Implemented individual discipline pages
- Added training mode for each discipline
- Implemented memory display and recall functions

### 5. User Dashboard
- Created user profile dashboard
- Implemented training history view
- Added personal records tracking

### 6. Documentation
- Created comprehensive documentation in `/docs` folder
- Added database schema descriptions
- Documented authentication flow
- Created deployment instructions

## Deployment Process

### Building for Production
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the application
npm run build
```

### GitHub Deployment
```bash
# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Prepare for deployment"

# Push to GitHub repository
git push
```

### Cloudflare Pages Configuration
1. Log in to Cloudflare Dashboard
2. Navigate to Pages
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Configure build settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Build output directory: `.next`
   - Node.js version: 18.x (or latest LTS)
5. Add environment variables:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your Supabase anonymous key
   - Other environment variables as needed

### Deployment Considerations
1. **Environment Variables**: Ensure all required environment variables are set in Cloudflare
2. **API Routes**: Verify API routes are working correctly in production
3. **Authentication**: Test authentication flow in production environment
4. **Database Access**: Confirm database connections are properly established

## Remaining Tasks

1. **Complete Training Modules**:
   - Finalize all training discipline implementations
   - Add difficulty levels for each discipline

2. **Competition Features**:
   - Implement competition scheduling
   - Add real-time competition functionality
   - Create leaderboards for competitions

3. **User Experience Improvements**:
   - Add progress tracking visualizations
   - Implement achievements system
   - Add social sharing capabilities

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Optimize image loading and rendering
   - Implement caching strategies
   - Minimize JavaScript bundle size

5. **Testing**:
   - Add unit tests for core functionality
   - Implement end-to-end testing
   - Perform cross-browser compatibility testing

## Maintenance

### Regular Updates
- Keep dependencies updated
- Monitor Supabase usage and quotas
- Review and optimize database queries

### Backup Strategy
- Implement regular database backups
- Store configuration files securely
- Document any changes to the project structure

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- Authentication failures: Check Supabase configuration
- Styling inconsistencies: Verify Tailwind configuration
- API errors: Check environment variables and network requests
