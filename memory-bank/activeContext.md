# Test Memory - Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on implementing additional features and enhancing the user experience. The project has the following status:

1. **Project Setup**: Completed
   - Next.js with TypeScript configured
   - Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui integrated
   - Project structure established

2. **Authentication**: Mostly Complete
   - Supabase integration completed
   - AuthProvider implemented
   - Middleware for protected routes created
   - Login and registration pages implemented
   - Profile management page implemented

3. **Database**: Configured
   - Schema established in Supabase
   - Tables created with relationships
   - Row Level Security policies implemented
   - Triggers for automatic profile creation and record updates set up

4. **UI Components**: Improved
   - Base shadcn/ui components integrated
   - Navbar with authentication state implemented
   - Theme switching functionality implemented
   - Added missing lucide-react package for icons

5. **Disciplines**: Completed
   - Disciplines listing page implemented
   - Decimal Digits discipline completed
   - Binary Numbers discipline completed
   - Matrices discipline completed
   - Shapes and Colors discipline completed

## Recent Changes

1. Implemented Shapes and Colors discipline:
   - Created Shapes and Colors discipline page with difficulty selection (Basic, Intermediate, Advanced)
   - Implemented interactive UI for selecting shapes and colors
   - Added utility functions for shape icons and color classes
   - Created a scoring system that evaluates both shape and color matches
   - Implemented a visual feedback system for results comparison

2. Added utility functions:
   - `generateShapesColorSequence` for creating random shape and color combinations
   - `calculateShapesColorScore` for scoring shape and color selections
   - `getShapeIcon` for rendering shape symbols
   - `getColorClass` for applying Tailwind CSS color classes
   - `getShapesColorCount` for determining number of items based on difficulty

3. Improved user feedback:
   - Added visual previews when selecting shapes and colors
   - Enhanced result displays with visual indicators for correct/incorrect answers
   - Implemented responsive grid layouts for mobile and desktop

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks (Current Sprint)

1. Create a records page to view personal bests
2. Add user feedback and animations to improve training experience
3. Implement discipline statistics to show progress over time
4. Add a dashboard with training insights

### Upcoming Tasks (Next Sprint)

1. Enhance profile page with avatar uploads
2. Implement the leaderboards functionality
3. Develop the competitions system
4. Add more sophisticated scoring system that rewards speed and accuracy

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Training Interfaces**: Each discipline follows a similar pattern (ready, memorizing, recalling, result) but with specific UI adaptations
2. **Scoring System**: Different scoring approaches for different disciplines:
   - Decimal/Binary: 10 points per correct digit, stops at first error
   - Matrices: 10 points per correct cell
   - Shapes/Colors: 5 points per correct shape + 5 points per correct color
3. **Performance Optimization**: The matrices and shapes/colors disciplines may need optimization for mobile devices
4. **User Experience**: Interactive selection interfaces for shapes/colors improve usability
5. **Difficulty Progression**: Each discipline has tailored difficulty levels appropriate to their complexity
6. **Visual Feedback**: Enhanced result displays with visual indicators help users understand their performance
7. **State Management**: Considering whether to use more complex state management like Zustand for competition features
