# Test Memory - Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on implementing the memory training disciplines, starting with the Decimal Digits discipline. The project has the following status:

1. **Project Setup**: Completed
   - Next.js with TypeScript configured
   - Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui integrated
   - Project structure established

2. **Authentication**: Mostly Complete
   - Supabase integration completed
   - AuthProvider implemented
   - Middleware for protected routes created
   - Login and registration pages implemented
   - Profile management page implemented

3. **Database**: Configured
   - Schema established in Supabase
   - Tables created with relationships
   - Row Level Security policies implemented
   - Triggers for automatic profile creation and record updates set up

4. **UI Components**: Improved
   - Base shadcn/ui components integrated
   - Navbar with authentication state implemented
   - Theme switching functionality implemented
   - Added missing lucide-react package for icons

5. **Disciplines**: In Progress
   - Disciplines listing page implemented
   - Decimal Digits discipline page created
   - Decimal Digits training functionality implemented
   - Other disciplines pending implementation

## Recent Changes

1. Fixed the project name in all pages from "Speed Memory" to "Test Memory"
2. Fixed missing lucide-react package that was causing errors
3. Created Memory Bank documentation with project structure and requirements
4. Implemented the Decimal Digits training discipline with:
   - Difficulty selection
   - Training interface with timed digit display
   - Scoring system
   - Results view with personal records

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks (Current Sprint)

1. Implement Binary Numbers discipline
2. Implement Matrices discipline
3. Implement Shapes and Colors discipline
4. Create a records page to view personal bests

### Upcoming Tasks (Next Sprint)

1. Enhance profile page with avatar uploads
2. Implement the leaderboards functionality
3. Develop the competitions system
4. Add animations to improve the training experience

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Training Interface**: The current training interface follows a pattern that can be reused for other disciplines with some modifications
2. **Scoring System**: Using a simple system where each correct answer gives 10 points and stops counting after the first error
3. **Performance Optimization**: Ensuring the timed display works reliably across devices
4. **State Management**: Currently using React state for training state - may need more complex state management for competitions
5. **Data Persistence**: Using Supabase to store training results and automatically update records
6. **UX Flow**: Creating a consistent flow between discipline selection, difficulty selection, and training
