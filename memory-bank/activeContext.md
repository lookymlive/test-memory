# Test Memory - Active Context

## Current Focus

We are currently in Phase 4 of development, focusing on enhancing the UI/UX and implementing comprehensive statistics for the training sessions.

### Active Work Areas

1. **Statistics Dashboard Enhancement**
   - Implementing more detailed visualizations for user progress
   - Adding trend analysis for performance over time
   - Creating discipline-specific performance insights

2. **UI Refinements**
   - Polishing transitions between training stages
   - Improving mobile responsiveness for all disciplines
   - Enhancing visual feedback for user actions

3. **Competition System Planning**
   - Designing database structure for competitions
   - Planning UI for competition participation
   - Developing leaderboard components

## Recent Changes

- Added position indicators for sequence elements ("Digit X of Y")
- Implemented progress bars for remaining display time
- Enhanced animations for sequence transitions
- Created personal records page with discipline tabs
- Built statistics dashboard with key performance metrics

## Next Steps

1. **Short Term (Current Sprint)**
   - Complete statistics dashboard enhancements
   - Fix remaining responsive design issues
   - Optimize database queries for performance

2. **Medium Term (Next Sprint)**
   - Begin competition system implementation
   - Add profile avatar upload functionality
   - Implement password reset flow

3. **Long Term**
   - Multi-language support
   - Offline mode
   - Advanced analytics
   - Testing and deployment preparation

## Active Decisions

- Using client-side rendering for training interfaces to ensure precise timing
- Implementing statistics calculations on the client to minimize database load
- Planning to use Cloudinary for image management when implementing avatars
- Considering implementation of a notification system for competitions
- Enforcing strict security practices: never exposing API keys in documentation or code repositories
